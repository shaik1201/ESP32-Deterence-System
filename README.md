# cats_detection

Identify and notify when cats enter my yard so i would be able to prevent them from defecating there. Using python with opencv.

Main goal for now:
- track cats movement in the yard, record the time and notify me through an email.

Future goals:
- after trcaking the movement, turn on a spinkler to keep the cats away.
- Use arduino. (currently using an old laptop to run the script in real time).
